## 1.3.0

### Upgrade information

This release is not backwards compatible with v1.2.x. Upgrading will change the node's database schema and
migrate local state to a new database. The migration will take place at the first startup after the upgrade.
Be aware that after upgrading you cannot downgrade to v1.2.x any more.

Current release is expected to be adopted by majority of the network participants before epoch 11 starts.
Nodes that do not update before epoch 11 risk their proposals being rejected by the rest of the network.

This release is the first step towards separating PoST from the node. Proof generation is now done via a dedicated
service. This service is started automatically by the node and is shut down when the node shuts down. In most
setups this should work out of the box, but if you are running into issues please check the REAMDE.md file
for more information on how to configure the node to work with the PoST service.

* [#5118](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/5118) reduce number of tortoise results returned after recovery.

  this is hotfix for a bug introduced in v1.2.0. in rare conditions node may loop with the following warning:

  > 2023-10-02T15:28:14.002+0200 WARN fd68b.sync mesh failed to process layer from sync {"node_id":

* [#5091](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/5091) Separating PoST from the node into its own service.
* [#5061](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/5061) Proof generation is now done via a dedicated service
  instead of the node.
* [#5154](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/5154) Enable TLS connections between node and PoST service.

  PoST proofs are now done via a dedicated process / service that the node communicates with via gRPC. Smapp users can
  continue to smesh as they used to. The node will automatically start the PoST service when it starts and will shut it
  down when it shuts down.

* [#5138](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/5138) Bump poet to v0.9.7

  The submit proof of work should now be up to 40% faster thanks to [code optimization](https://github.com/spacemeshos/poet/pull/419).

* [#5143](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/5143) Select good peers for sync requests.

  The change improves initial sync speed and any sync protocol requests required during consensus.

* [#5109](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/5109) Limit number of layers that tortoise needs to read on startup.

  Bounds the time required to restart a node.

* [#5171](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/5171) Set minimal active set according to the observed number
  of atxs.

  It will prevent ballots that under report observed atxs from spamming the network. It doesn't have impact on rewards.

* [#5169](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/5169) Support pruning activesets.

  As of epoch 6 activesets storage size is about ~1.5GB. They are not useful after verifying eligibilities
  for ballots in the current epoch and can be pruned.

  Pruning will be enabled starting from epoch 8, e.g in epoch 8 we will prune all activesets for epochs 7 and below.
  We should also run an archival node that doesn't prune them. To disable pruning we should configure

  ```json
  "main": {
    "prune-activesets-from": 4294967295
  }
  ```

* [#5189](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/5189) Removed deprecated "Best Provider" option for initialization.

  With v1.1.0 (<https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/releases/tag/v1.1.0>) selecting `-1` as `smeshing-opts-provider`
  has been deprecated. This option has now been removed. Nodes that already finished initialization can leave this setting
  empty, as it is not required any more to be set when no initialization is performed. For nodes that have not yet created
  their initial proof the operator has to specify which provider to use. For Smapp users this is done automatically by
  Smapp, users that do not use Smapp may use `postcli -printProviders` (<https://github.com/spacemeshos/post/releases>)
  to list their OpenCL providers and associated IDs.

* [#5207](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/5207) Move the NiPoST state of a node into a new node-local database.
  
  The node now uses 2 databases: `state.sql` which holds the node's view on the global state of the network and `node_state.sql`
  which holds ephemeral data of the node.

  With this change `post.bin` and `nipost_challenge.bin` files are no longer used. The node will automatically migrate
  the data from disk and store it in the database. The migration will take place at the first startup after the upgrade.

* [#5209](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/5209) Removed API to update poet servers from SmesherService.

* [#5259](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/5259) Node now tries to fix a 1.2.x config to be compatible with
  1.3.x at startup.

## v1.2.0

### Upgrade information

This upgrade is incompatible with versions older than v1.1.6.

At the start of the upgrade, mesh data will be pruned and compacted/vacuumed. Pruning takes longer for
nodes that joined the network earlier. For 1-week-old nodes, it takes ~20 minutes. for 3-week-old
nodes it takes ~40 minutes. The vacuum operation takes ~5 minutes and requires extra disk space
to complete successfully. If the size of state.sql is 25 GiB at the beginning of upgrade, the WAL file
(state.sql-wal) will grow to 25 GiB and then drop to 0 when the vacuum is complete. The node will resume
its normal startup routine after the pruning and vacuum is complete. The final size of state.sql is
expected to be ~1.5 GiB.

A new config `poet-request-timeout` has been added, that defines the timeout for requesting PoET proofs.
It defaults to 9 minutes so there is enough time to retry if the request fails.

Config option and flag `p2p-disable-legacy-discovery` is dropped. DHT has been the only p2p discovery
mechanism since release v1.1.2.

Support for old certificate sync protocol is dropped. This update is incompatible with v1.0.x series.

### Highlights

### Features

* [#5031](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/5031) Nodes will also fetch from PoET 112 for round 4 if they
  were able to register to PoET 110.
* [#5067](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/5067) dbstat virtual table can be read periodically to collect
  table/index sizes.

In order to enable provide following configuration:

```json
"main": {
    "db-size-metering-interval": "10m"
}
```

### Improvements

* [#4998](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/4998) First phase of state size reduction.
  Ephemeral data are deleted and state compacted at the time of upgrade. In steady-state, data is pruned periodically.
* [#5021](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/5021) Drop support for old certificate sync protocol.
* [#5024](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/5024) Active set will be saved in state separately from ballots.
* [#5032](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/5032) Ativeset data pruned from ballots.
* [#5035](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/5035) Fix possible nil pointer panic when node fails to persist
  nipost builder state.
* [#5079](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/5079) increase atx cache to 50 000 to reduce disk reads.
* [#5083](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/5083) Disable beacon protocol temporarily.

## v1.1.5

### Upgrade information

It is critical for most nodes in the network to use v1.1.5 when layer 20 000 starts. Starting from that layer
active set will not be gossipped together with proposals. That was the main network bottleneck in epoch 4.

### Highlights

### Features

* [#4969](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/4969) Nodes will also fetch from PoET 111 for round 3 if they
  were able to register to PoET 110.

### Improvements

* [#4965](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/4965) Updates to PoST:
  * Prevent errors when shutting down the node that can result in a crash
  * `postdata_metadata.json` is now updated atomically to prevent corruption of the file.
* [#4956](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/4956) Active set is will not be gossipped in every proposal.
  Active set usually contains list of atxs that targets current epoch. As the number of atxs grows this object grows as well.
* [#4993](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/4993) Drop proposals after generating a block. This limits
  growth of the state.

## v1.1.4

### Upgrade information

### Highlights

### Features

* [#4765](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/4765) hare 3 consensus protocol.

Replacement for original version of hare. Won't be enabled on mainnet for now.
Otherwise protocol uses significantly less traffic (atlest x20), and will allow
to set lower expected latency in the network, eventually reducing layer time.

### Improvements

* [#4879](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/4879) Makes majority calculation weighted for optimistic filtering.
The network will start using the new algorithm at layer 18_000 (2023-09-14 20:00:00 +0000 UTC)
* [#4923](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/4923) Faster ballot eligibility validation. Improves sync speed.
* [#4934](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/4934) Ensure state is synced before participating in tortoise
  consensus.
* [#4939](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/4939) Make sure to fetch data from peers that are already connected.
* [#4936](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/4936) Use correct hare active set after node was synced.
  Otherwise applied layer may lag slightly behind the rest.

## v1.1.2

### Upgrade information

Legacy discovery protocol was removed in [#4836](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/4836).
Config option and flag `p2p-disable-legacy-discovery` is noop, and will be completely removed in future versions.

### Highlights

With [#4893](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/4893) Nodes are given more time to publish an ATX
Nodes still need to publish an ATX before the new PoET round starts (within 12h on mainnet) to make it into the
next PoET round, but if they miss that deadline they will now continue to publish an ATX to receive rewards for
the upcoming epoch and skip one after that.

### Features

* [#4845](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/4845) API to fetch opened connections.

  "p2p": {
    "ip4-blocklist": [],
    "ip6-blocklist": []
  }
}
```

### Improvements
