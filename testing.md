mp## Testing Notes

### Running all tests

`make test`

### Generating a Code Coverage Report
`make cover`

### CI for cloud building & testing
See [Continuous Integration](ci.md)


### Checking Out and Testing Pull Requests

- Open up the .git/config file and add a new line under [remote "origin"]:

- ```fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/pull/origin/*```

Now you can fetch and checkout any pull request so that you can test them:

- Fetch all pull request branches
```git fetch origin```

- Checkout out a given pull request branch based on its number
```git checkout -b 999 pull/origin/999```


### The Table-driven pattern for tests is good!
